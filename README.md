## Prompt Engineering: In-context learning with GPT-3 and other Large Language Models

A client has a system that collects news artifacts from web pages, tweets, facebook posts, etc. The client is interested in scoring a given new artifact against a topic. The client has hired experts to score a few of these news items in the range from 0 to 10; a score of 0 means the news item is totally NOT relevant while a score of 10 means the news item is very relevant. The range of results between 0 and 10 signifies the  degree of relevance of the news item to the topic. 
The client wants to explore how useful existing LLMs such as GPT-3 are for this task.I am are hired as a consultant to explore the efficiency of GPT3-like LLMs to this task. If my recommendation is positive, I must demonstrate that my strategies to design prompts are reproducible and produce a consistent result.
